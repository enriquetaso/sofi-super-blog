            <p>Hi there! 👋</p>
            <p>I am Sofia, a Python developer 🐍 from Argentina who's currently living in Ireland. 🇦🇷 🇮🇪 </p>
            <p>I am a core member of the open source <a href="https://www.stackalytics.io/report/contribution?module=cinder-group&project_type=openstack&days=60 ">Openstack project</a>, and I'm currently working as a software engineer at <b>Red Hat</b> on the block storage team.</p>
            <p>When I'm not driking Guinness, I like to keep myself busy maintaining a few Django apps, including one called <a href="https://github.com/enriquetaso/sofi-super-blog/tree/main/finance">Millennials in Finance</a> a spending tracker. I even created an easy-peasy <a href="https://t.me/MillennialsInFinanceBot">Telegram Bot</a> to make things more fun!</p>
            <p>I've started my tech journey as an <a href="https://www.opnfv.org/blog/2019/01/16/opnfv-intern-spotlight-sofia-enriquez"> intern at the Linux Foundation</a>. That experience was such a blast, I even went on to mentor twice for their Outreachy internship program. And if that wasn't enough, I recently joined the Grace Hopper Celebration as a mentor for their Open Source BootCamp - so you could say I'm a mentor extraordinaire. 🫶 </p>
            <p>This blog is a place where I share my thoughts on tech, life, and everything in between. I hope you enjoy it! 🍀</p>
